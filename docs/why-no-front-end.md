# Why there is no front end

Little Hotelier is a database with a subscription. The tables underneath it are ordinary: a few entities, a few relationships, a handful of workflows you repeat every week. What you pay for is the layer on top that lets people who do not write SQL get at those tables. Screens, filters, dashboards, forms.

That layer used to be the whole product, because talking to a database was hard. It is not hard any more. Open this folder in Claude Code, describe what you want, and it writes the query, runs it, and explains the answer. Ask a question the dashboard never had a chart for and you still get an answer.

## What you gain

- **Better answers.** A dashboard shows what the vendor decided to chart. Here you ask your own question, in your own words, and get it answered against your own data.
- **No seats.** Everyone who needs to look can look. The bill does not grow with headcount.
- **Your data in your Postgres.** Plain tables. Back them up, query them from anything, leave any time. There is no export step because there is nothing to leave.
- **A process that matches you.** When your way of working changes, you add a command. You do not wait for a feature request to clear.

## What you give up

- **The tape chart.** Little Hotelier's calendar lets you drag a booking from one room to another. Here you ask for availability and say which room: `/availability`, then `/move`.
- **A live channel manager.** Little Hotelier pushes rates and availability to Booking.com and Expedia over live connections. The free version syncs calendars by iCal, which is slower and does not carry rates. See docs/replace-little-hotelier.md.
- **A booking engine on your website.** Guests cannot book themselves in here. Enquiries come to you, and you book them.
- **Card payments.** Payments are recorded, not taken. Your card terminal or payment provider takes the money.
- **A phone app.** It runs where Claude Code runs.
- **A vendor help desk.** This is open source. Enterprise DNA supports the installed version for businesses that want someone to call.

## Who this fits

Small teams who already use Claude Code, or who would rather learn to ask than learn another interface. If your team needs a screen to look at all day, or your bookings depend on a live channel connection you cannot live without, keep Little Hotelier, or have Enterprise DNA build those parts into your version. If you need the answers more than the screens, this is cheaper, faster and yours.
